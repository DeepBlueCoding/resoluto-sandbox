# resoluto-sandbox

Run a program in isolation and exchange data through a durable store. Your program stays plain — it
reads `argv`, writes `stdout`/files, exits, and never imports `resoluto_sandbox`. A script that runs
with `uv run agent.py` on your machine runs unchanged inside the sandbox.

## Install

```bash
pip install resoluto-sandbox   # published wheel coming; for now: pip install -e .
```

---

## Quickstart

```python
from resoluto_sandbox import Sandbox

result = Sandbox(backend="local").run(
    ["python", "-c", "print('hello from the sandbox')"]
)
print(result.output)   # hello from the sandbox
print(result.ok)       # True
```

The result captures the output, the exit code, and any files you asked to collect (`output_paths`).
`stdin` is not supported — pass inputs via argv, env, or workspace files.

> The local backend runs in a Kata microVM and needs a lane image present in its containerd — pass
> `Sandbox(backend="local", image="…")` (default `resoluto-sandbox-base:dev`; build it from
> `Dockerfile.base`). Run argv with the **guest's** `python` and workspace-relative paths, not host
> absolute paths.

**Verify both backends end to end** with the smoke test — it runs a minimal agent through `local`
(Kata via nerdctl) and `k8s` (Kata pod) and asserts input (argv + env) → output (stdout +
`result.json`):

```bash
set -a; source store.env; source ../local.env; set +a
uv run python examples/smoke_both_backends.py        # or --local-only / --k8s-only
```

## The program contract

A sandbox program reads `argv`, writes to `stdout` / files, exits with a code, and never imports
`resoluto_sandbox`. A script that works as `uv run agent.py` works unchanged inside the sandbox; test
runners, LLM agents, and shell scripts all qualify. Dependencies are your program's concern — put
`uv run` / `pip install` in your argv, or bake them into the image.

---

## How it works

The host and the sandbox never hold a live connection. They rendezvous through a durable key/value
store (the Conduit): the sandbox is passive — it writes append-only JSONL chunks and a final
`result.json`; the host launches it, tails the chunks, and reaps it. The same flow works whether the
sandbox is a microVM next to you or a pod in a cluster, and a network blip can't wedge a run.

```
stage → run (isolated) → collect
```

1. **Stage** — the host writes your workspace into the Conduit as an input archive.
2. **Run** — the runtime launches an isolated sandbox over the lane image. Inside it, the generic
   `runner_main` (your program never sees it) verifies egress isolation with a fail-closed canary,
   stages your inputs into `/workspace`, runs your `argv`, and streams spans, heartbeats, the result,
   and an output archive back to the Conduit. Output streams live to `stream` (default `sys.stdout`).
3. **Collect** — when the program exits, the host fetches the outputs and assembles a `RunResult`
   (output, exit code, `output_paths` artifacts, and a parsed `result.json` if your program wrote one),
   then reaps the sandbox.

Two seams carry everything; one `SubstrateBackend` drives both:

- **`SandboxRuntime`** — where and how the program is isolated (launch / status / destroy).
- **`Conduit`** — the durable host ↔ sandbox exchange (`put` / `get` / `list_prefix`).

    H->>H: reap sandbox → RunResult(output, exit_code, artifacts)
```

## Backends

Pick by where it runs; the program, the flow, and the `RunResult` are identical. Each program runs in
a Kata microVM (separate guest kernel) in both. What differs is the Conduit and how egress is enforced:

| backend | where it runs | Conduit | egress isolation | needs |
|---------|---------------|---------|------------------|-------|
| `local` | a single host (microVM via `nerdctl` on a dedicated containerd) | bind-mounted `LocalConduit` | host-side firewall on the lane bridge | `scripts/local-backend-up.sh` (Kata + nerdctl + a dedicated containerd) |
| `k8s`   | a Kubernetes cluster (microVM pod) | object store (`S3Conduit`, minio/S3) | default-deny `NetworkPolicy` | a cluster with Kata + an S3 store + a pinned kube context |

For the `local` backend, run `scripts/local-backend-up.sh` until its canary is GREEN. For `k8s`,
inject a configured `SubstrateBackend` (or use `Sandbox(backend="k8s", image=…)`). Full setup —
including the vendor-neutral k8s stack — is in [`docs/backends.md`](docs/backends.md).

## `Sandbox.run()` reference

```python
Sandbox(backend="local").run(
    argv,                 # program + arguments
    *,
    workspace=None,       # working directory staged into the sandbox (default: cwd)
    stdin=None,           # unsupported — raises NotImplementedError
    env=None,             # dict overlaid on the sandbox environment
    output_paths=None,    # glob patterns collected back as artifacts
    stream=None,          # live output sink; None echoes to sys.stdout
) -> RunResult
```

`RunResult`: `exit_code`, `output`, `errors` (always empty — stdout/stderr are merged), `artifacts`,
`result` (parsed `result.json` if the program wrote one), `ok` (`exit_code == 0`).

---

## CLI

```bash
resoluto-sandbox run -- echo hi                          # local backend (default)
resoluto-sandbox run --backend k8s --image <img> -- python agent.py
resoluto-sandbox doctor                                  # check backend readiness
```

`--` separates sandbox options from the program argv.

## Status

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| `backend="local"` — Kata microVM via nerdctl + a dedicated containerd, host-side egress | **works today** (run `scripts/local-backend-up.sh`) |
| `backend="k8s"` — Kata microVM pod + object-store Conduit + NetworkPolicy egress | **works today** — needs a Kata cluster + store + kube context |
| `Conduit` + `LocalConduit`, `StdoutConduit`, `S3Conduit` (minio/S3) | **works today** |
| `GcsConduit` | **provided, unverified** — experimental |
| Language-neutral wire spec | **published** — see `spec/PROTOCOL.md` |
| Prebuilt image matrix + `image build` CLI | design / roadmap |
